<p>This is a bird studying app that I made.  To get it working on your local machine after cloning it, from the cloned directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install
</code></pre>
<p>That should install <a href="https://11ty.dev">11ty</a> the static site generator that I'm using to build the site via npm (if you don't have node and npm installed do that first).</p>
<p>Then to generate and run the site:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
</code></pre>
<p>That should start up a server and build the site into a <code>_site</code> folder. If you open your web browser and navigate to: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> you should be ready to go.</p>
